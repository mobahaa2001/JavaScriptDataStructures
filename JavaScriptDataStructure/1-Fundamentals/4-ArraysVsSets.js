// Arrays
// 1- You can always use arrays --> it's a highly flexible data structure and you can use arrays for any kinds of data and that's why in probably 99% of all scripts, you only see arrays if you have lists of data.
// 2- Must-use if order matters and/ or duplicates are wanted






// Sets
// 1- Only usable if order does not matter and you only need unique values.
// 2- Can simplify data access (e.g.finding, deletion) compared to arrays.
