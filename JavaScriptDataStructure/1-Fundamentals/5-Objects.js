// Object- A Closer Look
// An Object can look like this

{
    name: 'Mo',
    age: 21,
    greet(){
        console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
    }
}

//////////////-------Notes--------////////////////

// --> Object in general are unordered key value pairs of data.
// --> The element access is done with help of the key name, So of the property name.
// --> Objects are not really Iterable, There is the for-in loop which is built for objects, But you won't be able to use the for-of loop, you won't be able to access the values with help of some index or anything like that.
// --> Keys are unique, values are not... So every key name must only appear once, You can't have two age properties in the same object.
// --> Keys your properties actually have to be strings, numbers or symbols in JavaScript.
// --> Object in general, therefore can be summarized as Data Structures or as constructs that can store Data, But that also can contain extra functionalities.
